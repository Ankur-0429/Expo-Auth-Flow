# Expo Authentication Flow with NativeBase UI

Welcome to the Expo Authentication Flow project! This project provides a simple and secure user authentication flow using Expo, with a sleek and customizable UI powered by NativeBase. Additionally, it features request caching for database interactions and full TypeScript support for type-safe development.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implement a complete user authentication system with features like sign-up, login, and logout.
- **Beautiful UI**: Utilize NativeBase components to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
- **Request Caching**: Cache requests made to the database to reduce redundant network calls and improve app performance.
- **TypeScript Support**: Develop your app with confidence, thanks to full TypeScript type-checking.
